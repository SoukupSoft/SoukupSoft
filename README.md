Hi, I am the creator of the http://soukupsoft.clanweb.eu website.

What you *can* do:
- look at my repos
- help me with coding by testing the code
- use my techniques for your repos (I can help you via mail, just email me to soukup.martin012@gmail.com)

What you *shouldn't* do:
- replicate this account/any of the repos (you *can* fork the repos by using the dedicated command)
- update the files (send them via mail, please)
