Hi. I'm SoukupSoft, the creator of the http://soukupsoft.is-great.net website, and a big tech fan.

# How do I contribute?
Please **do**:
- look around
- help me by testing code in repos
- learn from any repos you're interested in
- contribute (if you can)

Please **don't**:
- violate GitHub's ToS
- impersonate me
- use any code (or portions of it) from my repos for malicious purposes

# More will come in the future.
